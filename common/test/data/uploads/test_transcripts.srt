LILA FISHER: Hi, welcome to Edx.

1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,430
I'm Lila Fisher, an Edx fellow helping to put

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,160
together these courses.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,830
As you know, our courses are entirely online.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,880
So before we start learning about the subjects that

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,890
brought you here, let's learn about the tools that you will

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,000
use to navigate through the course material.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,070
Let's start with what is on your screen right now.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,170
You are watching a video of me talking.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,890
You have several tools associated with these videos.

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,590
Some of them are standard video buttons, like the play

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,920
Pause Button on the bottom left.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,360
Like most video players, you can see how far you are into

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,630
this particular video segment and how long the entire video

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,170
segment is.

15
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,790
Something that you might not be used to

16
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,590
is the speed option.

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,320
While you are going through the videos, you can speed up

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,250
or slow down the video player with these buttons.

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,880
Go ahead and try that now.

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,320
Make me talk faster and slower.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,410
If you ever get frustrated by the pace of speech, you can

22
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,160
adjust it this way.

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,320
Another great feature is the transcript on the side.

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,099
This will follow along with everything that I am saying as

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,430
I am saying it, so you can read along if you like.

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,360
You can also click on any of the words, and you will notice

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,640
that the video jumps to that word.

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,580
The video slider at the bottom of the video will let you

29
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,660
navigate through the video quickly.

30
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,480
If you ever find the transcript distracting, you

31
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,940
can toggle the captioning button in order to make it go

32
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,230
away or reappear.

33
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,570
Now that you know about the video player, I want to point

34
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,520
out the sequence navigator.

35
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,430
Right now you're in a lecture sequence, which interweaves

36
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,940
many videos and practice exercises.

37
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,090
You can see how far you are in a particular sequence by

38
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,910
observing which tab you're on.

39
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,740
You can navigate directly to any video or exercise by

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,610
clicking on the appropriate tab.

41
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,310
You can also progress to the next element by pressing the

42
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,100
Arrow button, or by clicking on the next tab.

43
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,360
Try that now.

44
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,220
The tutorial will continue in the next video.
